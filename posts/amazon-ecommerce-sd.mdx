## 1. Functional Requirements

- Search for products.
  - Tell users whether the product can be delivered to their location when searching for products.
- Maintain cart and wishlist.
- Checkout.
  - Make payment and complete order.
- View past and current order information.

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

- Low latency for a good user experience.
  - User facing components must have low latency.
- High availability and high consistency.
  - Search needs to be highly available at the cost of consistency
  - Inventory and payment needs consistency at the cost of availability.

## 3. Database Design

        - UserID (PK)

    - Address DB (SQL)
        - Address ID (PK)
        - UserID (FK)
        - Effective Data (DTTM)

        - AddressLine 1 (string)
        - AddressLine 2 (string)
        - City (string)
        - Country (string)
        - Zip (alpha numeric)
    - Product DB (NoSQL - Document DB - DynamoDB or MongoDB)
        - items stored as json documents
    - Order DB (NoSQL, Document DB)
        - store all items in and order as an array of items within the same json document
    - Review DB (NoSQL, Key-Value DB)
        - key will be product id
        - rating
        - description
        - images/videos
        - userid
